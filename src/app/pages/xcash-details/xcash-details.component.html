      Welcome to the X-CASH Community
    </h1>

<p class="is-break-word has-text-white-ter">
  X-CASH is a community-driven blockchain offering flexible privacy,
  secure delegation, and strong consensus—built for a transparent yet
  adaptable on-chain ecosystem designed for long-term resilience.
</p>

<p class="is-break-word has-text-white-ter mt-4">
  Launched in 2018 as a fork of Monero, X-CASH introduced flex-privacy and
  later evolved with DPOPS, a VRF-based delegated consensus model that
  enables fair, community-governed network security.
</p>

<p class="is-break-word has-text-white-ter mt-4">
  Following this release, development slowed and the project entered a
  period of inactivity as the original maintainers stepped away. Today,
  X-CASH is being revitalized by the community with a renewed focus on
  stability, transparency, and long-term sustainability—built on proven
  technology and guided by decentralized governance.
</p>

<p class="is-break-word has-text-white-ter mt-4">
  Current development is focused on modernizing and simplifying the
  protocol, strengthening DPOPS and VRF-based consensus, and expanding
  interoperability through token wrapping and minting on other
  chains—laying the foundation for a stable, community-governed ecosystem
  designed for long-term growth.
