            <p>
              XCash-Labs is revitalizing X-CASH, originally launched in 2018 as a fork of Monero,
              with a renewed focus on stability, transparent governance, and long-term sustainability.
              The native asset of the XCash-Labs network is XCK, launched with no premine and no airdrops, 
              preserving the original principles of open, community-driven cryptocurrency.
