            <p>
              XCash Labs is revitalizing X-CASH, originally launched in 2018 as a fork of Monero,
              with a renewed focus on stability, transparent governance, and long-term sustainability.
              The native asset of the XCash Labs network is XLB, launched with no premine and no airdrops, 
              preserving the original principles of open, community-driven cryptocurrency.
            </p>

                governed by its community and built to endure. Rather than chasing rapid feature expansion,
                the project prioritizes correctness, transparency, and steady evolution-ensuring the network
